      <description>A socioÂ­ecological assessment of fisheries in three estuarine systems of the SW Indian Ocean&amp;mdash; The Rufiji Delta in Tanzania, The Tana Delta in Kenya and the Bonus samoir in Mozambique. The project aspire to identifying essential links for improved governance. The project aims to address issues including
 Develop a common understanding of available information on estuarine ecology and biophysical variability in 3 estuaries Identify and describe natural resource use by people living around estuaries Investigate socio-ecological linkages and feedback systems related to fisheries Construct models to simulate the outcomes of change, incl.</description>

      <description>Over 100 million people in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region live within 100km of the coast, with over 1 million working in the fisheries sector. The WIO is highly dependent on the ocean for economic stability, food security, and social cohesion. In recent years the region has seen dramatic and often poorly understood reductions in key fisheries, due to the combined effects of climate change, natural ecosystem variability, overfishing and degradation of key marine habitats.</description>
